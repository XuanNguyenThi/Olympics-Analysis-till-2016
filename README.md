# Olympics-Analysis-till-2016
This is my first project, any comments are welcome
To follow easily, I'd like to explain:
I downloaded original data from Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?resource=download 

There are 2 file names: "athlete_events" and "noc_data", but I cleaned "NA" items on "noc_data". So I uploaded revised and clean "noc_data" here.
Next, you will see all SQL codes, and their results.
Finally, these filtered data are put into Power BI, where I created charts and saves pictures here, thanks
